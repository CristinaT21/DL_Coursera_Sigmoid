    "#### Tasks:\n",
    "1. Complete week 4 of fourth course and week 1 and week 2 of the fifth course from specialization;\n",
    "2. Go step by step and try to remember and understand everything we did during the lesson;\n",
    "3. Train your own Object Detection model with Yolo (any version you wish, >= v8) (example tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etjkjZoG2F0)\n",
    "4. Play with https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2 SAM2 model from facebook, it's a really good segmentation model.\n",
    "    Although they say it's better to use WSL, I think a while ago I was able to run it on Windows, and also there is the HuggingFace version which should probably be easier to install in case you are on Windows.\n",
    "Good luck!"
